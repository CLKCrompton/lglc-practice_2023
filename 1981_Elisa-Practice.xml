          <p> May 16–18 Vancouver More than 500 women participated in the fifth Bi-national Lesbian
            Conference, held at Langara College. The event drew women from across Canada to discuss
            priorities such as childcare, fighting the Right, and the formation of a national
            lesbian organization. There were plenary sessions, workshops, an art display (“Woman to
            Woman,” at the Women in Focus Gallery), and a dance featuring the lesbian rock band Mama
            Quilla II (with Lorraine Segato). More than 200 women marched in Canada’s first lesbian
            pride march, from Robson Square through downtown Vancouver to the WECC. A final report,
            Lesbian Power: Organizing for the 80s, was published after the conference. </p>
